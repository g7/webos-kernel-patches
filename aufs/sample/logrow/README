Some of the linux filesystems can grow its size with being mounted by a
special tool. For example, the patched EXT2 and the native XFS.
While the filesystem supports growing its size, the loopback block
device doesn't. This patch, logrow-2.6.xx.patch, and a utility,
logrow.c, expands the size of the loopback device.
If you specify its backend file, then the utility expands it too.
You don't have to unmount it.

It may be useful for aufs users who wants to use the loopback as a
writable branch.

- apply the patch to your kernel
- make the logrow executable
  you may want to change KDIR variable in Makefile
- read test.sh
- and you will know how to use it


Enjoy!

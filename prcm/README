Some of the devices require a timeout before being woken up when multiple
devices are woken up sequentially. If the timeout is not long enough, this
can cause PRCM_FAIL to be returned, which causes a LunaSysMgr restart. These
two patches simply add a cond_resched to put the thread to the back of the
queue. This may increase the time for resume from suspend dependent on the
number of threads desiring CPU time. The wait has been empirically proven to
be a maximum of approximately 2 seconds. This is considered preferable to
the 60-120 seconds a LunaSysMgr restart requires.

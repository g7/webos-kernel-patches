Tell gcc to explicitly tune for cortex a8 hardware and force it to use that
instruction set. Note that this is still using -Os, as -O2 and PREEMPT cause
intermittent lockups.

Also modifies CFLAGS in arch/arm/Makefile to use cortex-a8 instructions for
extra ricer capabilities per Marco's suggestion.
